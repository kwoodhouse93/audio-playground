# audio-playground

WIP library of composable audio synthesis components based on PortAudio.

## Get it
Just `go get` it, as with any Go package:
```
go get -u github.com/kwoodhouse93/audio-playground
```

Note you will need appropriate PortAudio libraries. Check out the [Go PortAudio bindings](https://github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio) repo by gordonklaus for more information.
